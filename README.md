# CTN Statistics

## Why?

I have done too much mandatory covid testing in Hong Kong - so write a little script to see how "good luck" I am.

## Instruction

1. Install the packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create `data` directory
3. Run `python3 download.py` to download all the CTN data. You may want to modify the end date to reflect the latest date.
4. Run `python3 main.py` to start the analysis. It will output the CSV file.
